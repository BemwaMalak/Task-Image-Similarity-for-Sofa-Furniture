# Assessment Task: Image Similarity for Sofa Furniture  

## Objective  
Develop an **analytical-based image similarity solution** to match a given sofa image against a storage of sofa images and return:  
1. The **most similar sofa image** from the storage.  
2. The **similarity percentage**.  
3. The **product ID** of the matching sofa.  

### **Important Notes:**  
- **No machine learning or deep learning solutions** should be used.  
- The solution must rely on **analytical techniques**, such as feature extraction and comparison using libraries like `OpenCV`, `scikit-image`, or others.  

---

## Deliverables  
1. **Python Code**  
   - A Python implementation of the solution.  
   - Properly modularized and commented code.  

2. **Hosted Demo Link**  
   - Host the solution on a platform like **Streamlit** or **Gradio** to allow testing via a web interface.  
   - The demo should allow uploading a sofa image and displaying:  
     - The most similar sofa image.  
     - The similarity percentage.  
     - The product ID of the matched sofa.  

3. **Private Git Repository**  
   - You will be invited to a private repository containing the sofa image data.  
   - **Fork the repository** to work on the solution.  
   - Provide access to the repository so we can monitor your progress.  

4. **ReadMe Documentation**  
   - Clear instructions on setting up and running the solution.  
   - Details on the methodology used for image similarity.

## Task Requirements  
1. Implement the solution in **Python**.  
2. Host the demo link (e.g., using **Streamlit**, **Gradio**, or similar platforms).  
3. Commit regularly to the private repository.  
4. Complete the task within **5 days**.
